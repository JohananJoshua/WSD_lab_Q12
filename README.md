Lab Ex.12 Demonstrate Node.js file system module.

You are developing a simple blog application using Node.js and need to implement file-based storage for blog posts.
In this lab, you will use the Node.js File System (fs) module to create, read, update, and delete blog post files.
Each blog post will be stored in a "posts" directory as a separate text file.

 node createPost.js  #create a blogPost.txt file
 node updatePost.js  #update the file
 node readPost.js  #read contents from the file
 node deletePost.js  #delete the post file
